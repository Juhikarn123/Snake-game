Hello Everyone!! I am Juhi Kumari.
I Have created one snake game of single level.
This is wrriten in C language.
it does not support Graphics but it contains pointer to move.

--------------------------------------Description---------------------------------
How to run this:
       Use any platform to write this code..
in case of code block just click on run button . Execution will start in Command Prompt.
Note: Before running just check whether gcc is working or not if not the made the set up to run.
it will ask u to click any button to run .
then again click enter button . the pointer will start moving . as fruit to eat there is 'F' letter . if the snake is eating the Fruit 
then length of snake will increase as well score also will increase . 
there are 3 life lines if snake will touch the border and itself then life line will decrese.
after completion of all life lines game will end automatically . 
and it will ask for player name and also you can see past History.
